	<div class="faq" id="faq_3">
		<p>We want you to be comfortable, but we'd love to see you in dressy clothes. Since we're having a March wedding, we're planning on staying inside, please wear comfy shoes. Please don't wear white or ivory. It will make the bride cry and you'll look like a jerk.</p>

	<button class="button" style="vertical-align:middle" onclick="toggle_visibility('faq_4');"><span>Do I have to RSVP? Can I bring my kids? Can I bring a date?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></button>
	<div class="faq" id="faq_4">
		<p>Yes, if you don't RSVP then you need to bring your own chair, your own food, and you don't get any free drinks. We love kids, that's why we included them on the invitation! 
		We tied a ticket to your invitation; the number on that ticket is how many seats we've reserved for you and your party. Don't worry, you don't need to bring the ticket with you!</p>

	<!--<button class="button" style="vertical-align:middle" onclick="toggle_visibility('faq_5');"><span>Why is there so much time between the ceremony and reception? What can I do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></button>
	<div class="faq" id="faq_5">
		<p>There's tons to do! We have to take all those pictures where we stare lovingly into each other's eyes as newlyweds. If that sounds super boring you can visit the Tree Adventures and climb the 50 foot tree house, stroll through the greenhouse, learn to plant a tree and so much more. Also the bar opens at 5 PM.</p>
